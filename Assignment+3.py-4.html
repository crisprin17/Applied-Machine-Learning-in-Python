# # Assignment 3 - Evaluation
# 
# In this assignment you will train several models and evaluate how effectively they predict instances of fraud using data based on [this dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud).
#  
# Each row in `fraud_data.csv` corresponds to a credit card transaction. Features include confidential variables `V1` through `V28` as well as `Amount` which is the amount of the transaction. 
#  
# The target is stored in the `class` column, where a value of 1 corresponds to an instance of fraud and 0 corresponds to an instance of not fraud.

# Import the data from `fraud_data.csv`. What percentage of the observations in the dataset are instances of fraud?
# 
# *This function should return a float between 0 and 1.*

# ### Question 2
# 
# Using `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test` (as defined above), train a dummy classifier that classifies everything as the majority class of the training data. What is the accuracy of this classifier? What is the recall?
# 
# *This function should a return a tuple with two floats, i.e. `(accuracy score, recall score)`.*

# 
# Using X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test (as defined above), train a SVC classifer using the default parameters. What is the accuracy, recall, and precision of this classifier?

# *This function should a return a tuple with three floats, i.e. `(accuracy score, recall score, precision score)`.*

# ### Question 4
# 
# Using the SVC classifier with parameters `{'C': 1e9, 'gamma': 1e-07}`, what is the confusion matrix when using a threshold of -220 on the decision function. Use X_test and y_test.
# 
# *This function should return a confusion matrix, a 2x2 numpy array with 4 integers.*

# ### Question 5
# 
# Train a logisitic regression classifier with default parameters using X_train and y_train.
# 
# For the logisitic regression classifier, create a precision recall curve and a roc curve using y_test and the probability estimates for X_test (probability it is fraud).
# 
# Looking at the precision recall curve, what is the recall when the precision is `0.75`?
# 
# Looking at the roc curve, what is the true positive rate when the false positive rate is `0.16`?
# 
# *This function should return a tuple with two floats, i.e. `(recall, true positive rate)`.*

# ### Question 6
# 
# Perform a grid search over the parameters listed below for a Logisitic Regression classifier, using recall for scoring and the default 3-fold cross validation.
# 
# `'penalty': ['l1', 'l2']`
# 
# `'C':[0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100]`
# 
# From `.cv_results_`, create an array of the mean test scores of each parameter combination. i.e.
# 
# |      	| `l1` 	| `l2` 	|
# |:----:	|----	|----	|
# | **`0.01`** 	|    ?	|   ? 	|
# | **`0.1`**  	|    ?	|   ? 	|
# | **`1`**    	|    ?	|   ? 	|
# | **`10`**   	|    ?	|   ? 	|
# | **`100`**   	|    ?	|   ? 	|
